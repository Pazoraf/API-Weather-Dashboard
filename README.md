# API-Weather-Dashboard


## Description
My intention with this project was to create a weather dashboard application, so that a user can search for cities and see weather information for that city on the current date, and for five days after that date. I wanted to store any previous searches that the user had made so they could easily pull them up again.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/API-Weather-Dashboard/)
